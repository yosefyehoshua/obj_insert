DDIM Object Insertion Rules

Objective:
Implement a custom object insertion mechanism using DDIM inversion in the Stable Diffusion XL pipeline.
Focus on manipulating the attention mechanism during the forward pass to blend foreground (fg) and background (bg) images along a defined mask.

Context:
- Thesis on object insertion in diffusion models (SDXL).
- Focus on DDIM inversion and attention-based fusion.

Steps:
1. Invert both foreground and background images using DDIM inversion.
2. Save all intermediate noise latents (x_t) for both fg and bg.
3. Generate a binary mask for the boundary region between fg and bg (e.g., via alpha matting or edge detection).
4. During the forward denoising process:
   - Use the stored noise latents to re-generate the input images.
   - In the attention layers, replace the keys and queries at boundary regions with those from the noise.
   - Preserve original keys/queries in non-masked regions to maintain fg/bg fidelity.

Constraints:
- Use Python 3.10 in a Conda environment.
- Dependencies: Hugging Face diffusers and transformers.
- Must be compatible with SDXL pipeline.
- Ensure reproducibility of DDIM inversion (use fixed noise and scheduler settings).
- Mask should have soft edges or dilation to improve blending quality.

Goal:
Enable controllable, seamless blending of fg and bg images in diffusion generation by directly manipulating the attention tensors using a boundary-aware mask.
